This program takes from the arguement line two files 'astrograph' and 'flights'. The astrograph file is formated with a 
leading planet, followed by its connections and times between connections. To read a new leading planet, you must input 
'NEXT 0' or the program will terminate due to incorrect formatting. The file must finish with 'END' or it will also terminate.
From this file it will construct an astrograph object to be used later for comparison when establishing valid ship routes 
from the next file. The second file passed is called 'flights' and will be used to construct a graph of all flights throughout
the galaxy. 'flights' format is as follows| shipname (followed by a series of) departure planet departure time destination planet
and arrival time.When moving to the next ship, the keyword 'NEXT' must be used. The end of the file is finished with the
keywords 'NEXT' and 'END'. If the formatting is incorrect or any of the routes are invalid, the program will terminate.
Once the files have been read and verified, the program with then run Dijkstra's algorithm in order to find the longest
shortest route possible with the given data. The output of my 'flights' file is as follows.

BespinExpress : Leaves Dagobah at 31 Arrives at Bespin at 58
BespinExpress : Leaves Bespin at 400 Arrives at Corellia at 406
Didanic : Leaves Corellia at 1104 Arrives at Bakura at 1156

To construct and run please use bash BUILD.sh and bash RUN.sh
